# ASM Programming for Microprocessors
This repository is ARCHIVED!!!

Here, we learned the assembly programming for microprocessors and the various tasks which the system achieves through it.
## Setup
1. Install DOSBOX
2. Extract MASM611 folder to a drive and remember that location
3. Extract debugx and move the contents to MASM611 -> BIN folder.

Setup is now complete.
## Run
1. Run DOSBOX application.
2. In command propt which has now opened, type "mount d: d:\MASM611\BIN"(If successful, it will say that D drive is mounted as local directory.)
3. Type "d:" to change the directory to d.
4. Type debugx to start the program.
5. If you want to compile a program, type "ml program.asm", remove errors and successfully compile.
6. Type "debugx program.com" to run the program in debugging mode.
